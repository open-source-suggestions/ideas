# open source suggestions

Open source suggestions is a website used to add your open source project ideas to give a project idea for people who don't have one.

It uses hugo with [hugo-PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod.git) theme.

Why hugo? Because it's easier to add pages with markdown than html.

## How to contribute

Follow the guide [proposing an idea](https://opensourceideas.github.io/ideas/proposing/) or if you don't want to write markdown you can still add an issue.
