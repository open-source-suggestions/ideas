# open source suggestions

I don't have any open source project idea to make.

Then Open source suggestions is made for you.

## What is Open source suggestions ?

Open source suggestions is a website made to add your own open source project idea.

It uses hugo with [hugo-PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod.git) theme.

Why hugo? Because to add web content markdown is easier and more convenient than html.

## I have an idea I want to suggest

Follow the guide [proposing an idea](https://open-source-suggestions.github.io/ideas/proposing/).

If making a pull request is too difficult for you you can instead add an issue.
